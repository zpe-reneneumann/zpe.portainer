# Sample Containerfile for running the Rumble Explorer in a container, with screenshot support.
#
FROM debian:stable-slim

WORKDIR /opt/rumble

RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y chromium   # add wireless-tools if you want WiFi scanning

# Set AGENT_URL to be the download URL for your Linux Rumble Explorer. To
# find your URL, go to https://console.rumble.run/deploy/download/explorers. Select Linux as a target.
# Get the URL form the deployment instructions to copy it to the clipboard.
#
ENV AGENT_URL={{ AGENT_URL }}

# This ID is used to track the explorer even if the container is rebuilt.
# Set it to a unique 32 character hex ID. You can generate one via:
#
# $ openssl rand -hex 16
#
ENV RUMBLE_AGENT_HOST_ID={{ HOST_ID }}

# If you need to set environment variables to change the explorer behavior,
# you can do so via the ENV directive. Example:
#
# ENV RUMBLE_AGENT_LOG_DEBUG=true

ADD ${AGENT_URL} rumble-explorer.bin

RUN chmod +x rumble-explorer.bin

# For full functionality the Rumble scanner needs to send and receive raw
# packets, which requires elevated privileges.
USER root

# The argument `manual` tells Rumble not to look for SystemD or upstart.
